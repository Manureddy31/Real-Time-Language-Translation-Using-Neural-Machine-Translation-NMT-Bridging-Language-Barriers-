# Real-Time-Language-Translation-Using-Neural-Machine-Translation-NMT-Bridging-Language-Barriers-
This project leverages Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to enable real-time text and speech translation across multiple languages. Using transformer-based models, it ensures high accuracy and fluency. Built with Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and FastAPI, it supports seamless integration into web and mobile applications.
